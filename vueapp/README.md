## Project Notes:

Honestly struggled using the default scaffolding from Visual Studio, swagger caused me some problems calling the API the way I am used to
There is a hard code localhost port as a result of problems with swagger

Encountered problems with CORS too

UI is not the cleanest nor is it the smoothest, I appologize for that

Was going to try hosting it somewhere, but ran out of time

To use:
Need Node.js (insalled dependancies on install)
Used Yarn to install packages

Should be able to run the project after install packages from Visual Studio

Development was done half in Visual Studio, Half in VS Code

Minial packages were used, should have looked for a toolkit or used one I was used

Left default pages from Microsoft

Wanted to do a lot different with the front end, but spent too much time fighting with swagger

## FROM Microsoft
# vueapp

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
    1) Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
    2) Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).
